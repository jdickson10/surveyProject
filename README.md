# Figure 1
Figure 1 is a histogram representing the distribution of hindfoot length for the species DM.

# Figure 2  
Figure 2 represents the average weight per species in a bar graph.

# Figure 3
Figure 3 is a box plot comapring the average weight of the species merriami and eremicus.  A t-test was computed to test fot statistically significant different average values of weights between the two species.
