# Figure 1
Figure 1 is a histogram representing the distribution of hindfoot length for the species DM. From the figure there is one size class of animals caught, an area of concern is wether or not the capture method was size biased or are other individuals defined in different size classes more cryptic? 

# Figure 2  
Figure 2 is a scatter plot representing the relationshiop of weight and hind foot length of one species. This figure gives a snapshot of one life history trait and is useful as weight or hind foot length can be extrapolated if this information is missing in the data. 

# Figure 3
Figure 3 is a box plot comapring the average weight of the species merriami and eremicus.  A t-test was computed to test for statistically significant different average values of weights between the two species. With a p-value of less than 0.05 the differences in weigth is significant.
