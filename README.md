# Figure 1
Figure 1 is a histogram representing the distribution of hindfoot length for the species DM.

# Figure 2  
Figure 2 is a scatter plot representing the relationshiop of weight and hind foot length of one species.

# Figure 3
Figure 3 is a box plot comapring the average weight of the species merriami and eremicus.  A t-test was computed to test for statistically significant different average values of weights between the two species.
